Usage Guidance
:
	*Japanese fonts come in two widths: proportional and fixed.

	*Intel prefers that proportional fonts are used in communications.

	*Both proportional fonts and fixed-width fonts can be used in most operating system and applications, such as Microsoft Office* and Adobe*.



It is recommended to use proportional spacing for contemporary typesetting. Full-width is useful when the typeset text needs to look tabular or aligned vertically.
